The full year rate was 25.5%."              | 0.15 / 0.48          |

**Key Baseline Findings:**

- ✅ **Speed Improvement**: Fine-tuned model 2.5x faster (2.91s → 1.15s) - *Note: FT model is quantized (4-bit) while base model runs unquantized, contributing to faster inference*
- ✅ **Similarity Improvement**: 4.4x better semantic similarity (0.11 → 0.48)
- ✅ **Accuracy Improvement**: Fine-tuned achieved 10% vs 0% accuracy
- ✅ **Response Quality**: Base model gave generic "no access" responses, fine-tuned provided specific financial data
- ✅ **Domain Knowledge**: Fine-tuning successfully embedded financial domain knowledge

This baseline evaluation demonstrates that fine-tuning provided significant improvements across all metrics. The base model consistently responded with "I don't have access to real-time data" while the fine-tuned model provided specific financial figures and context.
